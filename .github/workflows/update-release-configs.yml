name: Update Release Configs

# This workflow generates release-please config files from your release-channels.yml
# Run this whenever you modify release-channels.yml to regenerate the config files
# This workflow is for PUBLIC repositories that need to use workflows from a PRIVATE repository
# It uses token-based checkout to access the private npm-release-workflows repository
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Ensure WORKFLOWS_ACCESS_GITHUB_TOKEN secret is configured (see docs/credentials.md)
# 2. Replace 'heroku' with your GitHub organization name
# 3. Replace 'npm-release-workflows' with the actual repository name if different
# 4. Copy this file to .github/workflows/update-release-configs.yml in your project
#
# USAGE:
# - Edit release-channels.yml in your project
# - Go to Actions → "Update Release Configs" → "Run workflow"
# - A PR will be created if the generated configs differ from committed versions
# - Review and merge the PR to commit both release-channels.yml and generated configs

  workflow_dispatch:
